# React-Game

This is a simple React javascript game that relies on state tracking. As it does not rely on a back end, it is deployed with Github Pages.

## How this app works

This app uses React components to display images from a static json file. Each is appended to the page inside of a larger wrapper, and each has two onClick events binded to them. Once pressed, the first function takes the ID of the image you selected and pushes into a blank state array. If you click an image that is already inside of this new array of IDs, you score is reset and you must start over. The second onClick function utilizes a Knuth shuffle to change the order the images are appended in.
